# **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Data Structure</span>**
Data structures are building blocks of a program. They are like pillars of a huge
structure. If a program is built using improper data structures, then the program may
not work as expected always. It is very much important to use right data structures for
a program.

# **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Time complexity-</span>**
When the software is developed, it is very important to consider space and time
complexities as essential parameters that are to be met by it. Software may be
developed, but, it may take a longer time to produce output and hence, it may not be
used. The same is the case with respect to space. A program should not occupy more
than a specific amount of memory. Both these parameters are technically termed as
Time and Space complexities. A program/algorithm is analysed for its space and time
complexities. 

# **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Arrays-</span>**
The most common basic data structure is Array. Arrays can store the
elements which are of same data type. Arrays can be single or multi-dimensional. The
representations of arrays inside the memory are not uniform.

# **<span style= "color: #1fe076">lists-</span>**
the other data structure is lists. a list can be represented using arrays or
pointers. if pointers are used, then, the operations on the list such as insertion,
deletion etc. will become easy. also, the time complexity of such programs is less
when compared to programs which represent lists using arrays. 

## **<span style= "color: #1fe076">types of lists</span>** <br>
1> Linked List/Singly Linked List <br>
2> Doubly Linked List <br>
1> Circular Linked List <br>
1> Doubly circular Linked List <br>

Different types of lists are exists.
Data structures enable a programmer to structure a program in such a way that the
data are represented in the same way as they are
represented in real life. <br>


## **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Stack-</span>** <br>
A Stack is a last-in-first-out data structure. It means that the
latest element which entered the Stack will be the first to leave. A Stack can be
represented using Arrays or Linked lists.

## **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Queue-</span>** <br>
A queue is a first-in-first-out data
structure. It means that the first element that entered the queue will be the first to leave
it. A queue can be implemented using arrays or pointers. However, a lot of flexibility
is associated with a queue implemented using pointers. Also, the topic of Dequeue is

## **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Trees-</span>** <br>
The most important data structure is Tree. A Tree is having a
large number of applications in real life. Both Binary Trees and Trees are discussed.<br>

## **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Types Of Trees-</span>** <br>
Binary search Trees, AVL Trees and B-Trees are advanced versions of binary Trees.

## **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Graphs-</span>** <br>
Basically A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting these nodes. Graphs are versatile structures that can model a wide range of relationships and connections between entities.

## **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Searching-</span>** <br>
The most frequent operation that is performed in most of the software is Searching.<br>
i.e. A search algorithm is an algorithm which accepts an argument â€˜aâ€™ and
tries to find the corresponding data where the match of â€˜aâ€™ occurs in a file or in a
table.

## **<span style= "color: #1fe076">Sorting-</span>** <br>
Another frequent operation that is performed in most of the software is Sorting.
Different sorting algorithms such as Quick sort, Heap Sort, Bubble Sort and Merge
Sort. 

## **<span style= "color: #1fe076">ABOUT course-</span>** <br>
In this course, the topic of File structures is also discussed.
Different types of File organizations are discussed. Finally, some of the advanced data
structures such as Splay Trees, Red-black Trees and AA Trees are also discussed in
this course.
