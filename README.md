        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Data Structure</span>
    </h2>
    <p> 
        Data structures are building blocks of a program. They are like pillars of a huge structure. If a program is built using improper data structures, then the program may not work as expected always. It is very much important to use right data structures for a program.

    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Time Complexity-</span>
    </h2>
    <p> 
        When the software is developed, it is very important to consider space and time complexities as essential parameters that are to be met by it. Software may be developed, but, it may take a longer time to produce output and hence, it may not be used. The same is the case with respect to space. A program should not occupy more than a specific amount of memory. Both these parameters ar technically termed as Time and Space complexities. A program/algorithm is analyse for its space and time complexities.

    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Arrays-</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The most common basic data structure is Array. Arrays can store the elements which are of same data type. Arrays can be single or multi-dimensional. The representations of arrays inside the memory are not uniform.

    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Lists-</span>
    </h2>
</div>
<p>
    The other data structure is lists. a list can be represented using arrays or pointers. if pointers are used, then, the operations on the list such as insertion, deletion etc. will become easy. also, the time complexity of such programs is less when compared to programs which represent lists using arrays.

    Different types of lists are exists. Data structures enable a programmer to structure a program in such a way that the data are represented in the same way as they are represented in real life. <br>

        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Stack-</span>
    </h2>
    </div>
    <p> A Stack is a last-in-first-out data structure. It means tha the latest element which entered the Stack will be the first to leave. A Stack can be represented using Arrays or Linked lists.

    <p>
        A queue is a first-in-first-out data structure. It means that the first element that entered th queue will be the first to leave it. A queue can be implemented using arrays or pointers However, a lot of flexibility is associated with a queue implemented using pointers. Also the topic of Dequeue is

        Basically A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting these nodes. Graphs are versatile structures that can model a wide range of relationships and connections between entities.

<h2><span style="color: #1fe076;">Linked List</span></h2>
</div>
<P>
    the linked list is a chain of structures in which each structure consists of data as well as pointer, which
    stores the address (link) of the next logical structure in the list. it is also called "singly linked list".
</P>

    <h1>
        <span style="color: #1fe076;">doubly linked list</span>
    </h1>
</div>
<p>
    in a singly linked list, each element contains a pointer to the next element. we have seen this before. in
    single linked list, traversing is possible only in one direction. sometimes, we have to traverse the list in
    both directions to improve performance of algorithms. to enable this, we require links in both the directions,
    that is, the element should have pointers to the right element as well as to its left element. this type of list
    is called doubly linked list.

</div>

<p> As we seen before in linked list, the last node of singly linked list contain the null address/link. but in case of <span style="color: #1fe076;">'circular linked list'</span> the last element points the frist element.
<br> i.e. 'a linked list in which the last element points to the first element is called circular linked list. the chains do not indicate first or last element; last element does not contain the null pointer. the external pointer provides a reference to starting element'.

<p>A doubly circular linked list have both the features of <span style="color: #1fe076;">circular linked list</span>and
<span style="color: #1fe076;">doubly linked list</span><br /> i.e. a doubly circular linked list is a type of linked list in which each node in the list contains data andtwo pointers, similar to a doubly linked list. the key difference is that in doubly circular linked list, the last node in the list points back to the first node, creating a circula structure. additionally, the first node's previous pointer points to the last node, completing the circular link.<br>
