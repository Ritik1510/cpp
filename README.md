        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Data Structure</span>
    </h2>
    <p> 
        Data structures are building blocks of a program. They are like pillars of a huge structure. If a program is built using improper data structures, then the program may not work as expected always. It is very much important to use right data structures for a program.

    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Time Complexity-</span>
    </h2>
    <p> 
        When the software is developed, it is very important to consider space and time complexities as essential parameters that are to be met by it. Software may be developed, but, it may take a longer time to produce output and hence, it may not be used. The same is the case with respect to space. A program should not occupy more than a specific amount of memory. Both these parameters ar technically termed as Time and Space complexities. A program/algorithm is analyse for its space and time complexities.

    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Arrays-</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
        The most common basic data structure is Array. Arrays can store the elements which are of same data type. Arrays can be single or multi-dimensional. The representations of arrays inside the memory are not uniform.
    </p> 
</div>

<div>
    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Lists-</span>
    </h2>
</div>
<p>

</p>
the other data structure is lists. a list can be represented using arrays or
pointers. if pointers are used, then, the operations on the list such as insertion,
deletion etc. will become easy. also, the time complexity of such programs is less
when compared to programs which represent lists using arrays. 

<div>
    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">types of lists</span>
    </h2>
    <p>1> Linked List/Singly Linked List </p>
    <p>2> Doubly Linked List </p>
    <p>3> Circular Linked List </p>
    <p>4> Doubly circular Linked List </p>
    <p>
        Different types of lists are exists. Data structures enable a programmer to structure a program in such a way that the data are represented in the same way as they are represented in real life. <br>

<div>
    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Stack-</span>
    </h2>
    </div>
    <p> A Stack is a last-in-first-out data structure. It means tha the latest element which entered the Stack will be the first to leave. A Stack can be represented using Arrays or Linked lists.
    </p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Queue-</span>
    </h2>
    <p>
        A queue is a first-in-first-out data structure. It means that the first element that entered th queue will be the first to leave it. A queue can be implemented using arrays or pointers However, a lot of flexibility is associated with a queue implemented using pointers. Also the topic of Dequeue is

    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Trees-</span>
    </h2>
    <p> 
        The most important data structure is Tree. A Tree  having a large number of applications in real life. Both Binary Trees and Trees are discussed.<br>

    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Types of Binary Trees-</span>
    </h2>
    <p>1> Binary search Trees </p>
    <p>2> AVL Trees </p>
    <p>3> B-Trees </p>

    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Graphs-</span>
    </h2>
    </p> 
        Basically A graph is a data structure that consists of a set of nodes (or vertices) and a set of edges connecting these nodes. Graphs are versatile structures that can model a wide range of relationships and connections between entities.

    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Searching-</span>
    </h2>
    <p> The most frequent operation that is performed in most of the software is Searching.<br> i.e. A search algorithm is an algorithm which accepts a argument â€˜aâ€™ and tries to find the corresponding data where the match of â€˜a occurs in a file or in a table.</p>

<div>
    <h2>
        <span style= "color: #1fe076">Sorting-</span>
    </h2>
    </p> Another frequent operation that is performed in most of the software is Sorting. Different sorting algorithms such as Quick sort, Heap Sort Bubble Sort and Merge Sort.

    <p>In this course, the topic of File structures is also discussed. Different types of File organizations are discussed. Finally, some of the advanced data structures such as Splay Trees, Red-black Trees and AA Trees are also discussed in this course.
